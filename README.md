This is a **Codecool** solo project created during the last module of the school. This is my very first React app where I learnt the basics through different assignments.

The application retrieves data from the Pokemon API, and makes it fun to browse pokemons.

It has been deployed with the help of Netlify: [reactomon-k9t5h.netlify.app](https://reactomon-k9t5h.netlify.app/)
