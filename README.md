# Assignment: Reactomon in Context

## Description
Evolve your previously written Reactomon++ App!

## Tasks
You can choose from two options (choose both for a fully evolved Reactomon App):

- add a [Theme switcher button](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/3482593/screenshots/6844698/switch.gif) to your **Navbar**
    - it should affect at least 2 components anywhere in your component tree
    - you should switch between a colourful and a blackandwhite theme
    - colours are up to you
    - [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/introduction-react-context-api/) could help a lot
- or implement a Gotta Catch 'Em All whatever
    - add a Catch! button to every listed Pokemon on **PokemonList** component
    - add a Catch! button to the **PokemonDetail** component
    - every catched Pokemon should go to your Context
    - create a new Route and a **CatchedPokemons** component for your catched Pokemons and list them
    - be creative! I would wrap every catched Pokemon in a pokeball.

## Requirements
- use React's **Context API**
